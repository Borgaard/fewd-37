<p>
  Finish the exercise DOM manipulation exercise we started in class. Here's what you will need:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download the <a href="week-5/dom-manipulation.html">DOM Manipulation</a> HTML file
    (right click, save). You may have already done this in class note <strong>there are
    new pseudo-code comments that you'll want to read</strong> (unless you want to take a crack
    at it yourself without my hints).
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out how <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute">setAttribute()</a></code>
    works.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take a peek at Element's <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList">classList</a></code>
    property. There are two ways to solve the third set. Next week, I'll ask you to compare/contrast
    the two methods. You can accomplish it with <code>setAttribute()</code> but you can also
    use <code>classList</code> too. Maybe try both!
  </li>
  <li>
    Watch this video of me demoing the solution:

    </a>
  </li>
  <li>Suffer. Learning to do things you've never done before is hard.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Feeling totally stuck? Here's a tip: look at the code we wrote together in class
  for that first set. Above each line write a little comment to yourself explaing what it does.
  This is your chance to explain what the hell the JS is doing. You should have one comment
  above each line. Then step away for a few minutes, delete the code (leave the comments), and
  <strong>re-write</strong> the code using your pseudo code. This translation process will
  be super helpful for you--especially if you felt like you couldn't complete the set in-class.
