<h1>Questions for YOU to answer:</h1>

<p>
  There are lots of questions that come up in class that aren't necessarily
  worth answering in the moment or are a great opportunity for <em>you</em>
  to learn something new and explain it to the class. Pick a question, find
  the answer, and then put together an explanation that the whole class can
  understand.
